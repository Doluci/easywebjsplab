= Mercurial Status = 

Mercurial support on Google Code is currently an experimental feature, only available to invited users.  This document tracks the status of this feature as it evolves.

== What Works ==

  * pushing and pulling code to https://projectname.googlecode.com/hg
  * commit emails
  * source browsing
    * viewing individual changesets & diffs
    * visualizing the changeset DAG
    * code reviews


== What Doesn't Yet Work ==

  * the wiki still lives in a separate svn repository - issue 2508
  * source browser doesn't allow viewing alternate heads (or branches/tags) - issue 2509
  * projects receiving email notifications will receive one email per commit instead of one email per push - issue 2510
  * project's "activity stream" doesn't get updated yet
  * webhooks do not yet fire
  * no auto-starring of commits


== Caveats ==

During the experimental period, we may need to make schema changes to the underlying Bigtable database.  There may be occasional 2-hour windows of time where Mercurial repositories are taken offline for the data upgrade (we'll email with advance warning.)
