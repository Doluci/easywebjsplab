Mercurial support on Google Code is currently an experimental feature, only available to invited users.  This document tracks the status of this feature as it evolves.

== What Works ==

  * pushing and pulling code to https://projectname.googlecode.com/hg
  * single commit email sent for each 'hg push'
  * wiki lives in a separate hg repository
  * source browsing
    * viewing individual changesets & diffs, navigating multiple parents
    * visualizing the changeset DAG
    * navigating between branches & tags
    * post-commit code reviews


== What Doesn't Yet Work ==

  * webhooks do not yet fire - issue 2512
  * no branch reviews - issue 2514

For the most up-to-date list, see [http://code.google.com/p/support/issues/list?can=2&q=component%3AMercurial the complete list of open Mercurial issues].

== Caveats ==

During the experimental period, we may need to make schema changes to the underlying Bigtable database.  There may be occasional 2-hour windows of time where Mercurial repositories are taken offline for the data upgrade (we'll email with advance warning.)
