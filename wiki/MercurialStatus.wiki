== What Works ==

  * pushing and pulling code to https://projectname.googlecode.com/hg
  * single commit email sent for each 'hg push'
  * wiki lives in a separate hg repository
  * webhooks - issue 2512
  * source browsing
    * viewing individual changesets & diffs, navigating multiple parents
    * visualizing the changeset DAG
    * navigating between branches & tags
    * post-commit code reviews


== What Doesn't Yet Work ==

  * no branch reviews - issue 2514
