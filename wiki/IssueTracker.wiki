#summary User guide for Google Code's issue tracker

<wiki:toc max_depth="1" />

= Introduction =

An issue tracker is an application that users and developers use to
maintain a database of software defects, change requests,
technical-support requests, development tasks, and other issues that
the project members must work to resolve. Since they're so central to
each developer's daily work, many issue tracking systems have already
been built. Most existing issue tracker tools force developers to
follow a particular software development process by defining a set of
fields, possible values, and workflow states for each issue. The
result is often a complex tool that's difficult to use because it
includes many fields and options that aren't applicable to a given
issue.

In contrast, our issue tracker uses only a minimal set of fields, and
offers users the ability to store the information that they need as
labels. This approach is possible because it uses Google's free-text
search technology to search on all issue metadata.  Using labels
instead of fields makes the issue tracker much simpler to use.
Specifically, it allows developers to add any unsual information that
is important for a given issue without having to complicate the entire
user experience for every other issue.


= Quick start =

Here is how you can carry out the most common use cases with our issue tracker:

== How do I view open issues in a project? ==
   # Click the "Issues" tab in your project.

That page shows all open issues by default.  You can narrow the list by entering search terms or changing the query scope.  Then click the "Search" button in the page toolbar (directly below the main tabs).

== How do I enter an issue? ==

   # Click the "Issues" tab in your project.
   # Click the "New issue" subtab.
   # If the default issue template does not fit what you are trying to report, choose a different one.
   # Fill in the issue summary. In most cases you must edit the issue summary before the "Submit" button is enabled.
   # Fill in the issue description.  Answer any questions in the description prompt and add an additional information that you think would be helpful.
   # Optionally, attach screenshots or other files that help describe the issue.
   # If you are a project member or owner, you can also edit the issue status, owner, CCs, and labels.
   # Submit the issue

Most issue metadata is not offered to non-members. Instead, project
non-members are expected to it simply report what they see and what it
means to them.  It is the the responsibility of the project members to
triage issues and choose priorities, milestones, and issue owners.
Issue templates and filter rules can be used to help automate the
triage process, while still keeping the non-member user experience
very simple.

== How do I update an issue? ==
   # View the issue list
   # Click on the row for the issue, this takes you to the issue detail page.
   # Click on the large text area at the bottom of the page, or the link "Add a comment and  make changes below"
   # Enter the text of your comment
   # If you are a project member, you can also edit the project metadata
   # Click the "Save changes" button

When entering or updating the issue meta-data, each field or label is
presented as a plain text field with an auto-complete menu of
predefined choices.  Since these are text fields, you can always "just
type" without needing to do a lot of clicking.  Also, when dealing
with exception issues, project members are free to enter values that
are not among the predefined choices.

== How do I close an issue? ==
   # Follow the steps above to update the issue
   # Edit the status value to be one of the closed values.
   # Save changes

Only project members can close an issue.  If a non-member reports an
issue, and then wishes to withdraw it, he/she should simply comment on
the issue to explain that it can be closed without any work.

The status field is a plain text field, and you can enter uncommon
values there if it helps you express the state of the issue.  However,
only the predefined status values listed as "closed" will cause the
issue to be considered closed, any non-predefined value will be
considered to be open.  The project owner can define new open and
closed status values on the issue tracker administration page.


== How do I get notified when an issue is changed? ==

The most common way to do this is to star the issue by clicking on a
star icon on the issue list or issue detail page. On the user settings
page, you can set a preference for email notifications when an issue
that you have starred is updated.

The issue owner and any users listed on the CC line will also be
notified of issue changes.  That notification preference can also be
set on the user settings page.

Also, all issue changes are emailed to the "All issue activity"
address, if that is set by the project owner on the issue tracker
administration page.  Normally, that address would be the address of a
mailing list that allows anyone to subscribe.
