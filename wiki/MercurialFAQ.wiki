=== Why do I get "HTTP Error 405: Method Not Allowed" from the Mercurial client? ===

{{{
$ hg push
pushing to http://...
searching for changes
abort: HTTP Error 405: Method Not Allowed
}}}

You must push over *https* rather than *http*, e.g. `hg push https://MYREPO.googlecode.com/hg`.  If you clone via *https* initially, then a plain `hg push` will work.

=== How can I avoid typing my password in for each `hg push`? ===

You can enter a default push URL in your `hgrc` configuration file, and include the username and password in the URL.  The Mercurial FAQ has an [http://www.selenic.com/mercurial/wiki/FAQ#FAQ.2BAC8-CommonProblems.How_can_I_store_my_HTTP_login_once_and_for_all_.3F entry on this].  If you do this, make sure your `hgrc` isn't readable by others!

=== Why isn't my username/password accepted? ===

The following instructions are relevant to non-gmail users:

If you enter your username as part of the URL, you have to encode the "@" sign as "%40" to avoid confusing Mercurial. If you're on windows, % is an escape character in the command prompt, so you have to encode the "@" sign as "%%40".
