= How to Convert Subversion History to Mercurial =


== Option 1:  Top-Skimming ==

If you don't care about your project's history, then you can simply
"top skim" the latest trunk code from Subversion and put it into
Mercurial.  Assuming your googlecode Mercurial repository is empty,
it's as easy as:

{{{
  $ hg clone https://project.googlecode.com/hg hg-client
  $ cd hg-client
  $ svn export --force http://host/svnrepo/trunk .
  $ hg add .
  $ hg commit -m "Initial import of source."
  $ hg push
}}}


== Option 2:  Full History Conversion ==

If want to migrate your whole history, the process is much more
involved.  You'll need these special tools installed first.

=== Install tools ===

  * The 'hg convert' extension module.

      This already ships with recent Mercurial distributions; just
      make sure you're running hg version 1.1 or 1.2.  ("hg
      --version").

      Enable the extension by adding to your .hgrc:

{{{
         [extensions]
         hgext.convert=
}}}

  * The Subversion swig-python bindings

      Make sure you have a recent Subversion installed (1.5 or 1.6).
      Many distributions of Subversion ship with the python bindings,
      or offer "extra" binary packages of them.

      You can check that your svn-python bindings are installed
      correctly by running:

{{{
        $ python -c "import svn.core; print svn.core.SVN_VER_MINOR"
        5
}}}

      If this fails, or if you get a minor version less than 5, then
      something is wrong.

      If you have no binary package available and are desperate, you
      can build them from Subversion's own source tree:

{{{
        $ svn checkout http://svn.collab.net/repos/svn/tags/1.6.0 svn
        $ cd svn
        $ ./autogen.sh && ./configure
        $ make
        $ sudo make install
        $ make swig-py  # make sure you have swig 1.3 installed already
        $ make check-swig-py
        $ sudo make install-swig-py
}}}

      If you're on the Hardy version of Ubuntu, you can find version 1.5 of `python-subversion` in `hardy-backports`:

      http://packages.ubuntu.com/hardy-backports/python-subversion

      This may also require installing backports of the `libsvn1`, `subversion`, `mercurial-common`, and `mercurial` packages.

=== Doing the Conversion ===

Now we do the conversion -- branches, tags and all:

{{{
  $ mkdir hg-client
  $ hg convert http://host/svnrepo hg-client
}}}

Once the conversion is done, you can push the new history up to your
Google Code project (which presumably has an empty Mercurial
repository):

{{{
  $ cd hg-client
  $ hg push https://project.googlecode.com/hg
}}}
