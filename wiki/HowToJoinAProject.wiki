#summary Instructions on how to join a project

= How do I join a project? =

One of the project owners must use the project administration page to add your Google account email address to the project.

Most projects have mailing lists that the developers use to discuss the project. To become a developer, first participate on the mailing list by showing your interest in the project and your ability to help the project. Then, ask the project owners to make you a member of the project. 

*Please do not add comments to this wiki page asking for project membership.*  Only the project owner of the project that you want to join can add you to that project.  This is the "support" project, which is a completely different project.
